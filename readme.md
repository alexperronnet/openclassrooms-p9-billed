# Billed

## Overview

The objective of this project was to fix a series of bugs (listed [here](https://github.com/alexperronnet/openclassrooms-p9-billed/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)), to improve the test coverage and to realize an End-to-End test case.

I usually push projects to the max but to be honest this project was not interesting at all for a multitude of reasons so I preferred to do only what was asked so I could quickly move on.

### Why didn't I like this project?

- The project was not well documented
- The project was not well structured
- The project use a lot of deprecated packages
- The project use bootstrap and jQuery ðŸ¤¢
- The UI is not responsive
- The UI is not accessible
- I think that write tests for code built by someone else is a waste of time.
- I think that write tests after building a project is not a good practice.
- I prefer to write tests for code that I wrote myself, especially if the project was to learn testing.
